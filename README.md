# Cat Catalog

A web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to display a list of cat breeds and their details using The Cat API. This project fulfills the requirements of the Cat Catalog exercise, which involves creating a React-based application with a Home screen listing cat breeds and a detail screen showing information about a selected breed.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays a list of cat breeds fetched from The Cat API. Each breed name is clickable, leading to the detail screen.
- **Cat Breed Detail Screen**: Shows the selected breedâ€™s name, image, origin, life span, and description, with a "Back to Home" button.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Optional Features (Not Implemented)

- Search functionality for cat breeds on the Home screen.
- Additional UX improvements (e.g., loading states, error handling).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher.
- **npm** or **yarn**: For installing dependencies.
- **The Cat API Key**: A free API key from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) is required to fetch breed data and images.
